# 8.3.9r Ogs, Part 2
## Assignment
This program is an extension of your previous ‘Ogs’ program. Copy and paste your code, ask the user to input text, and then call your function to check the inputted text for the word “Goggles”.

In addition to just reporting how many words contained the word og, you should report the indices at which the words occurred in the list of words!

Here’s what an example run of your program might look like:

```text
Enter some text: Ogs are so cool! I think the word bedog is my favorite. Or maybe bogey.

There were 3 words that contained "og".
They occurred at indices: [0, 8, 14]
```

As you can see from the output, you’ll have to use another list to store the indices where you found the words containing “og”. To add items to a list, use the append method (more info on this method can be found in the Docs tab in Data Structures > List Methods)

The ```enumerate``` function might also come in handy!
